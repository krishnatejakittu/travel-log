# Introduction

Travelling is the kind of activity,
which almost all the people love. For someone it is an opportunity to relax and
abstract from everyday busy life. For others it is interesting to observe the way people of other cultures and
mentality live. Some people consider it to be the best way to have fun and always try to visit as many clubs,
pubs, restaurants and cafes as possible for their wallets and time limits.

Of course,
there are people who are always unhappy with the way the life is, and they will say that travelling is far from
pleasant and involves a lot of stress due to the necessity to pack
their things, use public transport and so on. But fortunately, those people are
rather few and the majority understands how travelling is exciting and interesting.

To help people in this endeavour I have
created a travel blog called as Travilla.


## Requirement Analysis

Requirements
for travilla include:
1.   
Home page 
2.      
A feedback mechanism
3.      
Additional references for users 

Travilla is required
because most of the blogs now a days give only the experience from the
bloggers’ view. Travilla will provide the extra edge where a user can now give
feedback of the places and get additional help to get more travel destinations.


# System Requirements

This system has
a user who can login and give feedback. The administrator can view this
feedback and make improvements. The admins job is to keep posting new data for
the users to see. 
Php with MySqli is used 
use Xampp or Apache as server


The feedback
table takes the user feedback and the users table takes the login information


## The concept

To implemented using web development technologies like html and css  for front-end along with javascript for validation . The backend is stored
in php using MySql as database schema.
